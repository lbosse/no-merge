# no-merge
Web extension that disables GitHub's merge button in pull requests

## A little background...
This extension came from a problem I was having at work. I just couldn't seem to
resist pressing that shiny green merge button upon approval of a pull request,
even if that branch hadn't been tested yet. This extension helps me think before
merging. Maybe it will help you too.
